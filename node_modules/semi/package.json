Now before you start to talk about how semicolons improve readibility simply because you also write other C-style languages, try to realize that JavaScript is not C, nor is it Java. Its semicolons are designed to be optional and dropping them can be a productivity boon for some people, including me. In fact, languages like Go and Groovy also have optional semicolons and the convention is not using them. You can even use semicolons in Ruby and Python, but obviously nobody does that because it's actually very easy to identify EOL as the end of a statement where it makes sense.\n\nNow, if you are adding semicolons everywhere because you fear dropping them can cause mysterious bugs in some weird browsers, break minifiers, or the rules are simply too hard to remember, you are doing it wrong. The correct way to deal with FUD is to confront them and understand the root cause. You should read these following articles:\n\n- [Semicolons in JavaScript are optional](http://mislav.uniqpath.com/2010/05/semicolons/)\n- [An Open Letter to JavaScript Leaders Regarding Semicolons](http://blog.izs.me/post/2353458699/an-open-letter-to-javascript-leaders-regarding)\n- [JavaScript semicolon insertions](http://inimino.org/~inimino/blog/javascript_semicolons)\n\nThis little tool can add semicolons to files written in a semicolon-less style, and can also remove semicolons from those written with semicolons. This allows you to write code in the style you like and just auto convert it when you are ready to commit your code into a codebase with a different style requirement.\n\nIt is implemented by [hacking jshint](https://github.com/yyx990803/jshint/commit/e7bb51d7f5e72db2ce98cd76d8657937dac498e5), and 100% preserves your original code formatting (other than semicolons). It even takes care of special cases where a newline semicolon is needed (see below).\n\n## Usage\n\n### CLI\n\n``` bash\nnpm install -g semi\n# if no --out is specified will overwrite original\nsemi [add|remove] [files ...] [--out dir]\n```\n\n### API\n\n``` js\nvar semi = require('semi')\n// semi.add(<String>)\nvar jsWithSemicolons = semi.add(jsWithoutSemicolons)\n// semi.remove(<String>)\nvar jsWithoutSemicolons = semi.remove(jsWithSemicolons)\n```\n\n## Special Cases\n\nSemi will automatically convert between the following two cases (also for newlines that start with `[`, `+`, `-` or a regex literal):\n\n``` js\n// A\nvar a = b;\n(function () {\n  /* ... */\n})()\n// B\nvar a = b\n;(function () {\n  /* ... */\n})()\n```\n\nHowever, it will not do anyting to the following, because there's no way for Semi to tell if you actually wanted to write it like this or not.\n\n``` js\nvar a = b\n(functon () {\n  /* ... */\n})()\n```",
